			App Cache
			=========

 - Also called as 'Offline pages'.

 - It is used to automatically save the page in the browser's memory, so that the page can run on the browser offline also, later.

 - Here, the system automatically stores the page on the browser's memory, without user interaction, when the page is opened for the first time.

 - Next time on words, the page runs locally (offline) from browser memory.

 - The programmer can force the browser to get a latest copy of the page, at-a-later time, by changing the some date in the ".appcache' file.
